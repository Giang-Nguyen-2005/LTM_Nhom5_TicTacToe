ARCHIVE: convert_encoding.py

This helper script was used during development to normalize file encodings
from UTF-16/BOM to UTF-8. It is no longer required in the cleaned repository.

A backup of the full repository was created before cleanup. If you need the
original helper, restore it from the backup zip in the parent folder.
